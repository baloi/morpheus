> important tests(from play/authentic/spec) :
  - caseload - add therapist and resident.physical_therapist
  - resident
  - therapist 
  - treatment
  - user

  - rehab day

D caseload - has treatments (add therapist and resident.physical_therapist)
D make therapist - resident work (or get data from the rails application)
D test should have a different database (refresh after every test)
D copy activerecord models insto model.rb

> simple post/therapist test via Capybara & httpclient
> simple post/therapist from smalltalk via http (no xml yet) deal with xml only with

> A Scheduler is a purely data crunching app that takes care of schedules, you can query or 
  feed schedules(in sched-data format) or request editing of specific areas in the schedules itself
  - input and display of data will be done by other applications.
  - http is the mode of communication between the Scheduler and it's clients
  - write simple tests and make it run with 'guard'

> smalltalk gui for scheduling system
> each request sends password too.
> create simplest protocol maybe with encryption?
